## Task 3: Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation

Understand the Problem:
Goal: Preprocess, Kaggle Breast Cancer dataset, train Random Forest to predict issue priority (high/medium/low), evaluate with accuracy and F1-score**.

Dataset: Kaggle Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29).

Note: The dataset is binary (Malignant/Benign); we’ll map to high/low priority for simplicity, as high/medium/low requires a multi-class dataset or synthetic labels. If you prefer a software issue dataset, let me know, and I’ll adjust.

Deliverable: Jupyter Notebook + performance metrics.

Tool: Google Colab.

Plan the Solution:

Load dataset in Colab.

Preprocess: Clean, encode labels, split data.

Train Random Forest model.

Evaluate with accuracy and F1-score.

Save notebook for submission.

Implement the Code:

Setup Google Colab:

Open Colab.

Create a new notebook (task3_predictive_analytics.ipynb).
